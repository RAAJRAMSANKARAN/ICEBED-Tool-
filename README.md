**ICEBED: ICe volumE and Bedtopography Estimation from DEM**

**ICEBED** is a software tool that helps estimate a glacierâ€™s ice thickness, ice volume, and ice bed
topography. This tool features a user-friendly GUI, enabling users to estimate the required outputs for one or multiple glaciers by following simple steps. 

The ICEBED tool includes the GlabTop2_IITBversion ice thickness modelling approach (refer to Ramsankaran et al., 2018), an improved version of the GlabTop2 modelling approach (Frey et al., 2014). This semi-automated approach estimates a reliable shape factor for glaciers lacking field measurements.It integrates the Glacier Bed Topography (GlabTop2_IITB) model an independently implemented GlabTop2 ice thickness model based on the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) concept and the assumption of perfect plasticity. The model is coded in MATLAB.

The ICEBED tool **requires only three primary inputs** to estimate spatially distributed ice thickness: **Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Surface slope, Glacier mask**

Details of **executing the ICEBED tool** can be seen in the instructions manual 'ICEBED Tool Instructions_V2'.
