ICEBED: ICe volumE and Bedtopography Estimation from DEM

ICEBED is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed for estimating glacier ice volume and bed topography. It integrates the Glacier Bed Topography (GlabTop2_IITB) model, an independently implemented GlabTop2 ice thickness model based on the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) concept and the assumption of perfect plasticity. The model is written in MATLAB.

The ICEBED tool requires only three primary inputs to estimate spatially distributed ice thickness: Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Surface slope, Glacier mask

In addition to ice thickness estimates, ICEBED also provides glacier bed topography as an output.

The GUI is designed for ease of use, ensuring accessibility for users without programming expertise. GlabTop2_IITB is a semi-automated model that introduces novel shape factor parameterization and applies to any valley glacier. Hence, modelled results will be one of the key model inputs for a simple method for estimating an optimal or near-optimal shape factor-based ice thickness estimation. Details of the modelling process can be seen in the instructions manual. The proposed parameterization method was validated using field measurements, demonstrating its robustness for glaciers where direct ice thickness measurements are unavailable.
